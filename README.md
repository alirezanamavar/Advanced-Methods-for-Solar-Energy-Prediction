## üìä Methodology  

1. **Data Sources:**  
   - Solar radiation data (`Radiation1400New.mat`).  
   - Hourly temperature data (`hourly_temperatures.mat`).  
   - Hourly rainfall data (`hourly_Rain.mat`).  
   - Practical power data (`Power.mat`).

2. **Theoretical Power Estimation:**  
   Calculate cell temperature, short-circuit current, and voltage to predict theoretical power output.

3. **Regression Model:**  
   A linear regression model is trained to predict power output based on temperature, radiation, and rainfall.
